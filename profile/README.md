# Destinatik Team [Product-based Capstone Project C241-PS022 Bangkit 2024 H1]
## Background
Traveling has become a popular hobby with high interest, and it contributes to the revenue of a region through tourist attractions. People tend to visit famous (viral) places, which impacts other attractions. This further amplifies the popularity of well-known tourist attractions while leaving lesser-known ones behind. The lack of information about tourist attractions contributes to their low visitor numbers. However, each tourist attraction has its own charm and uniqueness. The Department of Culture and Tourism of Bandung City recorded approximately 7.7 million tourists visiting Bandung.

Based on these issues and information, we have taken the initiative to develop a travel application that facilitates tourists in discovering recommended tourist attractions. "Destinatik" is a mobile application aimed at providing recommendations for tourist destinations based on visitor ratings, user preferences, and strategic locations. By utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning modeling, we have built the application using collaborative filtering algorithms.

# Implementation Design
we do the application design process using the web-based application [Figma][5]

# Features
These are our applications’s features. You can search the destination to look for the information. Then do a rating for the destination itself after you visit the place. You can also look for the maps, and additional features to switch to dark mode and push notifications. Before that things all, as a user you need to register if you don’t have an account in our app, then do login. If you have done using our app, you can also log out from your account.

# Installation
Apk file for app installation can be found on our latest release [here][6]
